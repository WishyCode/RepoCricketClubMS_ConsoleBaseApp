# Cricket Club Management System

This project is developed for the EE3351 Data Structures and Algorithms module in our 2nd year of studies. The system aims to manage cricket club activities such as event scheduling, practice session management, and user registration, all while utilizing C++ data structures for efficient operations.

## Features

- **Event Management:** Admins can add and manage cricket events, specifying details such as date, time, and venue.
- **Practice Session Scheduling:** Admins can schedule and manage practice sessions for club members.
- **User Management:** Efficient user profile management and quick searching using Binary Search Trees (BST).
- **Secure Credentials:** The system uses Maps for secure and validated user credentials.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Changes made by the admin are immediately reflected on the client side.
